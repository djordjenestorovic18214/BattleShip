The game of Battleship is thought to have its origins in the French game L'Attaque played during World War I. 
The first commercial version of the game was Salvo, published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company. 
Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's Combat: The Battleship Game, 
Milton Bradley's Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy and Maurice L. Freedman's Warfare Naval Combat. 
Strategy Games Co. produced a version called Wings which pictured planes flying over the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
All of these early editions of the game consisted of pre-printed pads of paper.

In 1967 Milton Bradley introduced a version of the game that used plastic boards and pegs. 
The method of play involved using pegboards and miniaturized plastic ships, and was thought of by Ed Hutchins. 
In 1977, Milton Bradley also released a computerized Electronic Battleship, followed in 1989 by Electronic Talking Battleship.
In 2008, an updated version of Battleship was released, using hexagonal tiles. 
In the updated version, each player's board contains several islands on which "captured man" figurines can be placed. 
Ships may be placed only around the islands, and only in the player's half of the board. 
When the movie Battleship was released, the board game reverted to the original 1967 style. 
The 2008 updated version is still available as Battleship Islands.

Battleship was one of the earliest games to be produced as a computer game, 
with a version being released for the Z80 Compucolor in 1979. Many computer editions of the game have been produced since. 
In Clubhouse Games for the Nintendo DS, Battleship is known as Grid Attack. 
It is played on an 8×8 grid, and includes slight variations, such as 4-player gameplay, 
various ship sizes and shapes, as well as the option to make the ships touch each other. 
Iterations of Battleship appear as applications on numerous social networking services.

A minigame version of Battleship was used in the third season of The Hub's Family Game Night, 
which uses a 5×5 grid and the first team to sink three ships wins the game.

In 2012, the science fiction action movie Battleship was released, which was inspired by the board game. 
A version of Battleship based on the movie was released in which one side had alien ship playing pieces.
