The game is played on two grids for each player. The grids are square – 8×8. 
On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. 
On the other grid the player records their own shots.

Before play begins, each player arranges their ships on their primary grid. 
Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. 
The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. 
The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). 
The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. 
In each round, each player takes a turn to click on a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. 
The server announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "miss", 
the server marks their primary grid with a white peg; if a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid with a red peg. 
The server marks on own "tracking" grid of attacking player the hit or miss on with the appropriate color peg 
(red for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk.
If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
